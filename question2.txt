Question 2 - How a C Program Moves From Source Code to Execution

This is a simple explanation of how a C program goes from the code we write to actually running on the computer. 

1. Preprocessing  
   - The preprocessor handles things like #include and #define before compilation starts.  
   - It basically expands header files and replaces macros.  
   - Possible error: If a header file is missing the preprocessor gives an error like "No such file or directory".

2. Compilation  
   - The compiler takes the preprocessed code and translates it into assembly code.  
   - This step also checks the syntax of our C program.  
   - Possible error: A typo like writing prinf instead of printf causes an "undefined function" error.

3. Assembly  
   - The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code (object file with .o extension).  
   - This is a lower-level translation step.  
   - Possible error: "invalid instruction" if the compiler produced something the assembler cannot handle.

4. Linking  
   - The linker connects our object file with external libraries (like the standard library that contains printf).  
   - It creates the final executable file.  
   - Possible error: "Undefined reference to printf" happens if stdio is missing or linking fails.

5. Loading  
   - The loader puts the program into memory and prepares it for execution when we run it.  
   - The operating system handles this step.  
   - Possible error: If the executable is corrupted or missing permissions we may get "cannot execute" or "permission denied".

Overall, these five stages work together to turn our C source code into a running program.
