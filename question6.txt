Question 6 - Identifier Naming Errors

The following identifiers have naming mistakes:

1) int 1value = 10;
   - Error: Identifiers cannot start with a number
   - Corrected: int value1 or int value = 10;

2) float avg-rate = 12.5;
   - Error: The hyphen (-) is not allowed in variable names because it is counted as a minus operator.
   - Corrected: float avg_rate or float avgrate = 12.5;

3) char Class = 'A';
   - Error: Not illegal but using a name that starts with a capital letter looks like a type name and should be avoided as it is not a good programming practice. 
     Variable names should not shadow common words or types.
   - Corrected: char class_grade = 'A';

Summary of Rules Violated:
- Identifiers cannot start with numbers.
- Identifiers cannot contain symbols like hyphens.
- Identifiers should not use confusing or misleading names.
