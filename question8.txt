In this program, I created one global variable and one local variable to show how scope works in C. 
The global variable is declared outside the main function, so it can be accessed anywhere in the program. 
The local variable is declared inside main(), so it only exists while main is running.

When the program prints both values, it shows that global variables have a wider scope and local variables aare limited to the function where they are created.
