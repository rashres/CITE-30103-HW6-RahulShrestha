Question 3 - What happens if #include <stdio.h> is removed?

If I remove #include <stdio.h> from a C program that uses printf, the compiler does not know the function prototype for printf anymore. This causes many issues during the compilation stage.

The exact stage that fails: Compilation (also linking sometimes)

Expected error messages:
1. During compilation:
   "warning: implicit declaration of function 'printf'"

2. During linking:
   "undefined reference to printf


The compiler warns that printf is not declared and the linker fails because it cannot find the actual printf function without the stdio library being included.
